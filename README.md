# Non-ASCII Character Checker

A React web application that identifies and highlights non-ASCII characters in text strings, making it easy to spot problematic characters in large text files or data imports.


## What are Non-ASCII Characters?

ASCII characters are standard English letters, numbers, and symbols (character codes 0-127). Non-ASCII characters include:
- Accented letters (é, ñ, ü)
- Special symbols (©, ™, €)
- Emojis (😀, 🎉)
- Characters from non-Latin alphabets (中, א, Ω)

This tool helps identify these characters when you need pure ASCII text.

## Usage

1. Paste or type your text into the textarea
2. The app automatically analyzes the text as you type
3. Non-ASCII characters are highlighted in yellow
4. View the count and list of unique non-ASCII characters at the top of the results
